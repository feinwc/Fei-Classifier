# Classifier Models
- The repo demonstrates some classifier models with different datasets from Multiple classifiers to Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier.
- I built some models using similar techniques at work to understand childrenswear shoppers' shopping behaviour. The result shows that the spend on ready-to-wear and shoes are highly associated with the likelihood of purchasing childrenswear.
